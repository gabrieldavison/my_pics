# TODO

For MVP

- [x] Fix sort to be in reverse chronological (new images at the top of the list)
- [x] Add redirect when page is created.
- [x] Make mobile responsive
- [ ] Implement better folder structure for image storage:
    - Images go in a folder named after their parent
    - When a child is created a new folder is created named after the parent and the child images are put in there.
    - This involves storing the file name on the image to make it easier to look up
- [ ] Fix redirect for login

- [ ] Add some a breadcrumb trail to make navigation easier.
    - e.g.  1 > 4 > 6 > 3 > 9
